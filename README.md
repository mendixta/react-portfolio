# React Portfolio 

# Summary 
For this weeks assignment, we were asked to create a portfolio using React where we can not only store our projects, but as well as a place where we can share our projects with other developers. 

The final result was this: <!-- Website Link -->


# Getting Started
When starting this assignment, I wasnt that confident in using React, I felt like I had a lot to learn before I could even begin creating the portfolio. 
When creating this portfolio, I referenced a few YouTube tutorials to help me get started, and the more I practiced, the easier it got.

# Issues
One of the main issues that I had while creating the portfolio was creating a responsive navigation bar:

One of the methods that I used when creating a responsive navbar, was using a package called 'react-router-dom' which is installed using npm i react-router-dom. When importing the package needed to create the links, for some reason, the package could not be found, even after installing the package again. 

After doing more research, I found another method to create a navbar referecing one of the class activities. 

# Final Thoughts
After working with React to create this portfolio, I feel a lot better about using it, as well as confident enough to use it in future projects. Of course, there is still A LOT of room for improvement, but I do feel a lot more confident now than I did when I first began this project.
